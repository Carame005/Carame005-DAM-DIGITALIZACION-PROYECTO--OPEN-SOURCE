# **Contributing to the Discord Bot**

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! We are excited to have developers like you help improve the bot and bring new ideas to life.

This project is intended to be a simple and fun way to explore Discord bot development. While we encourage new features, we also aim to keep the bot lightweight and easy to use.

Below are some guidelines to help you get started with contributing:

---

## **How You Can Contribute**

### **1. New Features**
We are open to new, fun, and creative features that can enhance the bot, but please remember that this is an informal project. The bot’s main purpose is to provide a simple and fun experience, so please:

- Keep new features **simple** and easy to use.
- Make sure that the features do not overly complicate the code or the user experience.
- Think about how users can easily interact with the bot using slash commands or simple text-based commands.

Some fun feature ideas could include:

- **Games**: Add small interactive games or quizzes.
- **Fun Responses**: Enhance the bot’s personality with more playful commands or roasts.
- **Utility Features**: Add simple but useful tools, like a server welcome message or server stats.

### **2. Modularization and Clean Code**
As this bot grows, it's important to keep things organized and easy to manage. Here are some practices to help us maintain a clean codebase:

- **Modularize features**: Add new functionality in a separate cog. Each cog should have a clear purpose and be easy to enable/disable.
- **Follow PEP 8**: Please adhere to Python’s PEP 8 style guide to ensure readability.
- **Keep the codebase light**: Avoid adding dependencies that are not essential to the bot's core functionality.

### **3. Bug Fixes & Performance Enhancements**
If you find any bugs or performance bottlenecks, feel free to submit a pull request (PR). When fixing bugs:

- **Test your changes**: Make sure that everything works as expected.
- **Keep it minimal**: Focus on fixing the issue at hand without introducing new features unless necessary.

---

### **4. Documentation**
Good documentation is key to helping others understand and contribute to the project. If you are adding new features or making significant changes, please update the documentation:

- **README**: Update the `README.md` with any new setup or usage instructions.
- **Code comments**: Include comments to explain complex parts of the code, so others can follow your logic easily.
- **Wiki**: Feel free to update the wiki with new guides, explanations, or feature documentation.

## **Things to Keep in Mind**
- **Keep it simple**: This bot is meant to be lightweight and easy to use. Avoid overly complex implementations.
